# Getting started

You can get started in several areas - Do you want to start using KubeVirt?
Or rather start coding? Take a look below to see where you can get started.

## As a user

If you have [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/) setup already,
then you can start right away by calling:

```bash
curl -L run.kubevirt.io/demo.sh | bash
```

Once it is deployed, take a look at the user documentation
<https://kubevirt.gitbooks.io/user-guide/> to learn how to use KubeVirt.

Otherwise you can read about how to setup `minikube` and deploy KubeVirt at
<https://github.com/kubevirt/demo>.
